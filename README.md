# Bias Correction Paper Replication

This repository contains the code to replicate several experiments for the paper:
"Debiasing the Random Forest Algorithm".


## Simulated Data Experiments

The repository `code/5-Simulations` contains code to replicate several experiments 
that test the bias corrected prediction algorithm for random forests in 
some simulated data sets.


## Data Inspired Simulations

For data inspired simulations, we generate synthetic data based on four real data sets.
